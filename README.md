A website for me, containing... stuff about me and by me. Not much else to say here, really.

I look forward to creating more pages to list repos I'm proud of in a fashion more friendly to demonstration than a simple GitHub link. Until then, enjoy the occassional blog post.

Currently using the [Time Machine](https://github.com/pages-themes/time-machine) theme.
