# About Me

Hi there. I am Erik G. Lopez, and if you couldn't tell already my handle uses my initials and last name. If you say "EGL" like a word, it sounds like "Eagle." This page will tell you a little bit about me.

I was born and raised in the Greater Chicago Area, where I continue to live. Illinois will probably be my home state for as long as I have my friends and family here, and deep dish pizza can't be beat!

In 2014 I began studying at <a href="https://www.elmhurst.edu/">Elmhurst University</a>, as it is now known, and worked toward my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. It was here that I became exposed to the world of software programming for the first time in my life. My studies were focused in C++ with some Java, web development, and even a bit of SQL to manage databases. The majority of my work was done with Visual Studio, or Eclipse with Java. I graduated in May 2018, and a few months later I found my first job in the tech world.

That said, I haven't stopped refining my programming skills outside of work. In the past I have helped people build and configure websites using languages like Liquid or JavaScript, and eventually used some of that knowledge to work on this website. Also, I'm always looking to challenge myself with programming puzzles and interesting project ideas. C++ is my preference, but I feel confident in picking up any new language as a tool to solve problems with.

Outside of professional life, I maintain a variety of hobbies. I play video games but also travel to compete across the country, I run and lift weights to stay in shape, I love jazz fusion, and I have some dogs I love very much. I personally consider terriers to be my favorite type of dog!

I am on LinkedIn! Feel free to connect with me <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-lopez-209033123/">here</a>, I am always open to learning about new professional opportunities.
