Okay, if you can see this then that means I have configured things properly. Whether or not the style is functioning correctly is another story, but I will take care to clean things up around here as needed.

Hello! I don't think any further introductions are needed for me. You can read about me [here]({% link about.md %}) if you haven't already.

Right now I am using this as a place to dip my toes into GitHub Pages, so hopefully it will look a lot nicer in the future. I plan to make pages for certain projects that I like or find interesting.
